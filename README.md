# Sakuga Tomo

Sakuga (作画) (lit., "drawing pictures") is a term used in anime to describe moments in a show or movie when the quality of the animation improves drastically, typically for the sake of making a dramatic point or enlivening the action. It's pronounced SA-ku-ga.

Sakuga Tomo (or Sakuga buddy/friend) is an Android application that retrieves posts from the sakugabooru.com website's API and displays them in a native UX for Android built using Jetpack Compose, Coroutines, Room and using some experimental features from the Compose library.
